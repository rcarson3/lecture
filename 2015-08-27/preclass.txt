## Reading questions

1.  A given program spends 10% of its time in an initial startup
    phase, and then 90% of its time in work that can be easily
    parallelized.  Assuming a machine with homogeneous cores, plot the
    idealized speedup and parallel efficiency of the overall code
    according to Amdahl's law for up to 128 cores.  If you know how,
    you should use a script to produce this plot, with both the serial
    fraction and the maximum number of cores as parameters.

    We just need to plot: S(p) = 1/(alpha +(1-alpha)/p) where alpha = 0.1 and 1<= p <= 128

    So we should see a speed up between 1 to 9.3431 for 1 processor and a 128 respectively.

2.  Suppose a particular program can be partitioned into perfectly
    independent tasks, each of which takes time tau.  Tasks are
    set up, scheduled, and communicated to p workers at a (serial)
    central server; this takes an overhead time alpha per task.
    What is the theoretically achievable throughput (tasks/time)?



3.  Under what circumstances is it best to not tune?

    When the amount of time spent on tuning is greater than the amount of time saved from the optimizations applied to the program.

4.  The class cluster consists of eight nodes and fifteen Xeon Phi
    accelerator boards.  Based on an online search for information on
    these systems, what do you think is the theoretical peak flop rate
    (double-precision floating point operations per second)?  Show how
    you computed this, and give URLs for where you got the parameters
    in your calculation.  (We will return to this question again after
    we cover some computer architecture.)
    
5.  What is the approximate theoretical peak flop rate for your own machine?
    Used info from your lecture on parallel architecture since mine has the same exact architecture i5-4228U

Max flops = 2 Flops/FMA * 4 FMA/vector FMA * 2 vector FMA/cycle * 2 corers * 2.6 Gcycle/s = 83.2 GFlop/s without boost
Max flops = 2 Flops/FMA * 4 FMA/vector FMA * 2 vector FMA/cycle * 2 corers * 3.1 Gcycle/s = 99.1 GFlop/s with boost

Would need to take into account also the amount of latency per cycle for this processor since this should lead to a lower amount of theoretical flops than predicted here. It might also be possible that the threads might change the amount of flops as well.
