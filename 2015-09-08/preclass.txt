Pre-Class Questions:

Consider the following naive row-based N x N matmul (matrix multiplication):

for (i = 0; i < N; i++){
   for (j = 0; j < N; j++){
      tmp = 0
      for (k = 0; k < N; k++)
         tmp += A[i,k] * B[k,j]
   }
      C[i,j] = tmp
}

Suppose data is in double-precision floating point. We are interested in
estimating the memory-based arithmetic intensity (AI) of this code. The
memory-based AI is defined that (# flops) / (# bytes transferred between memory
and cache), and depends on the cache size. Suppose the cache uses a
least-recently-used (LRU) policy for deciding which data to flush when moving
something into an already-full cache.

1. Suppose 16*N (bytes?)is significantly larger than the size of our L3 cache. What is
the memory-based AI of this code? (Hint: What is the memory-based AI of just the
innermost loop?)

Inner most loop is 1 multiplication and 1 addition operation per cycle for the double precision operations. We have 24 bytes of information (tmp, A, and B variables) being called during each operation if we don't account for the integer. If we assume we are working on a 64-bit system than the integer can be up to 8 bytes of information, so we are now dealing with 40 bytes of information each loop. 24 of those bytes (tmp, k, and N variables), are going to be constantly kept in memory, since they are being used each loop.  The inner loop should be around (16*N + 8) bytes for the double precision operations, and then  16 bytes for integer operations. The way B array is defined in the inner most loop it is going to be constantly going to be fetched from memory because we are accessing it column order. A row vector from A could then be stored in cache, since it has all its data right next to each other in memory. We could then store (8*N + 24) bytes of information in the cache potentially? 

We have 2 flops from the double precision.
(# of bytes transferred between cache and memory) worst case would be if we could only keep the 24 bytes in cache. Then we would have 16*N bytes of information transferred from memory to cache, and then 16*N for the reverse process.

So, if we assume the absolute worst than the AI would be roughly (2 flops*N)/(16*N) for the inner loop. If we had an actual L3 cache size than we could find an upper bound of the AI as well.

Overall, it would be (2 flops * N^3)/(16*N*N*N) = 1/8 for the worst case.


2. Now suppose that the cache is substantially larger than 16N, but
substantially smaller than 8N^2. What is the AI now?

It should now be (2 flops*N^3)/(8*N^3 + 8*N^2) = 1/4 roughly


3. Now suppose the cache is large enough to hold all of A, B, and C. What is the
AI now? (Hint: Writing to a byte of memory not already in the cache incurs two
memory transfers: one to move the data to the cache for writing, and one to move
the written data back to main memory.)

If we assume everything can be in cache than we should see an improvement to (2 flops * N*N*N)/(24*N*N) = N roughly


4. Cache overflowing. On my CPU (Intel i7-4700 HQ), L1, L2, and L3 caches are 32
KB, 256 KB, and 6 MB respectively. What is the largest problem size N that will
fit in each cache? What is the arithmetic intensity associated with each problem
size?

32KB - 32,768 B/8 B -> sqrt(4,096/2 mats) = 44 for N

256KB - 262,144 B/8 B -> sqrt(32,768/ 2 mats) = 128 for N

6 MB -  6,291,456 B/ 8 B->sqrt(786,432/2 mats)= 627 for N


5. My CPU has 4 cores, each of which can do 8 fused multiply-adds per cycle, has
a clock rate of 2.4 GHz, and a memory bandwidth of 25.6 GB/s. At what arithmetic
intensity does my machine become CPU-bound?

 2*8*4*2*2.4*1e9 = 307 GFLOP/S
 
 Memory Bandwidth for machine for double precision = 25.6 GB/s / 8B = 3.2 GB/s
 
 AI = 307/3.2 = 95.9 GFLOP/GB 


6. So, for what size range for N will naive matmul be CPU-bound on my machine?

sqrt(95.9*10e9/2 mats) = 218,974 for N assuming that you can manage to actually get the peak number of flop/s 


7. So, what will a plot of Flops/sec vs N look like?
